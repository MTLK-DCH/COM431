<?
/*
Use the class defined in cards.php to implement an additional game, Blackjack! A player is initially dealt two cards and is informed of the sum of the value of their rank.  Numbered cards (2,3,4,..) have value equal to their rank, while Jack, Queen and King have a value of 10 and Ace has a value of 11.  For example the Queen of Hearts and the 9 of spades would give a total of 18.  The objective of the game is to keep accepting cards until their total value is as close as possible to 21, without exceeding 21.  The game can be won in 3 ways: 

Receiving the King and Ace of Spades in the initial deal (Blackjack!). 

Accepting 5 cards without exceeding the total value of 21 

Having a score of 21 or lower which is higher than the score of the dealer. 

If the players “stands” (refuses the next card) while on a legal score, then the dealer is assigned a random number between 16 and 21 (inclusive).  If the player score is higher than the dealer’s, the player wins, otherwise the player loses.
